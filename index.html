            It all started with a Web Development course on Skillshare.com, 
            where I built a wiki page for the Minions. Fast-forward to today, 
            I’ve had the honor to build websites for a 
            <a href="http://wgtnisa.org/" target="_blank">non-profit organization</a>, 
            an <a href="https://powertrip.earth/" target="_blank">electric vehicle start-up</a>, 
            and interned at <a href="https://serato.com/" target="_blank">Serato</a>, the world's best 
            DJ software company.

            I am currently taking a gap year in the land down under, venturing 
            through the graffitied streets of Melbourne while taking online courses 
            in Mobile App Development and Machine Learning. This Fall, I will be 
            moving to Los Angeles, California to pursue a Bachelor of Science in 
            Computer Science at the 
            <a href="https://www.usc.edu/" target="_blank">University of Southern California (USC)</a>
        </p><br>
        <p>
            Outside of coding, I enjoy bouldering, working out, the morning sip of coffee, 
            rewatching Modern Family for the millionth time, catching sunrises, chasing sunsets, 
            and living in between.

                <p>2. it is the third most popular drink overall, after water and tea.[5] The production of beer is called brewing</p> 
                <p>3. which involves the fermentation of sugars, mainly derived</p>

             <p>A vine (Latin vīnea "grapevine", "vineyard", from vīnum "wine") in the narrowest sense is the grapevine (Vitis), but more generally it can refer to any plant with a growth habit of trailing or scandent (that is, climbing) stems, lianas or runners.
              The word also can refer to such stems or runners themselves, for instance when used in wicker work.[1][2] In the United Kingdom, the term "vine" applies almost exclusively to the grapevine. The term "climber" is used for all climbing plants.[3]</p>

             <p>Lemonade is any of various sweetened beverages found around the world, all characterized by lemon flavor. Most lemonade varieties can be separated into two distinct types: cloudy and clear; each is known simply as "lemonade" (or a cognate) in countries
              where dominant.[1] Cloudy lemonade, generally found in North America and India, is a traditionally homemade drink made with lemon juice, water, and sweetener such as cane sugar or honey.[2] Found in the United Kingdom, Ireland, South Africa, Australia,
              and New Zealand, clear lemonade is a lemon flavoured carbonated soft drink. Not to be confused with Sprite a lemon-lime flavored, soft drink.</p>
